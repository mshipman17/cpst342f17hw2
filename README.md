I enjoyed working with the bootstrap version better.  It seems easier to work with rather than the completing it on my own.  I was able to understand it better from a learning standpoint.
Too many challenges I encountered during this assignment.  After class on Thursday, I felt comfortable about the content but once I had to apply it into my work, it was challenging.  Mostly i had issues with trying to figure out the classes and when to end the </div>.  It makes a lot more sense to me after doing the bootstrap part.
I'm interested to see if the work I did was correct or if there is a better way to complete.
